# Fintech CaseStudy
Afterpay:  Payments Domain
# Afterpay 
## ***Background:***

* Afterpay was founded in 2014 by Nick Molnar& Anthony Eisen together in Sydney Australia. The two were neighbours at the time.

* The idea came through a discussion Nick had with Anthony about the future of retailing. Nick was particularly interested in this subject given his parents owned a jewlery store & Nick felt that online retailing was the way of the future and wanted to take the business to a new level.

* Additionally, the recessionary envirnoment at the time created yet another consumer tension that could be tapped into; young millenial consumers wanted more ways to access products and services through interest free payments. The only offer at the time were traditional credit cards and these were not seen as diserable for this consumer segment due to their lack of credit rating and also mistrust of the system which they belived would trap them in a cycle of debt.

## Landscape:

*What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*

* Primarily Payments & Billing. However  Nicholas Molnar argues; "Afterpay isn’t a payments platform but a way for retailers to find new customers and get them to spend more." He further adds, "This is primarily executed through the retailer taking on the "responsibility" of paying for the service without passing on the cost to their consumers".  https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/why-fashion-is-key-to-afterpay-s-staggering-success-20210211-p571jp

## ***Business Activites***

*How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*

* Afterpay received around AUD $8m in funding from a handful of investors when it was initially launched

* More recently, Afterpay received $19.4million from US venture capital fund Matrix Partners to support expansion into  the US. (source: https://www.businessnewsaustralia.com/articles/afterpay-lands-in-the-us--keen-for-a-slice-of--3-8-trillion-market.html…)

* Afterpay is also funded through shareholder investment having been listed on the ASX since May 2016 (Souce: https://www.fool.com.au/2020/05/14/if-you-invested-10000-in-the-afterpay-ipo-this-is-how-much-youd-have-now/)

*What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*

* Afterpay enables retailers to capitalise on a conversion gap between consumers wanting to buy, but unable to due to a lack cash flow. By enabling consumers to be "rewarded" with a laybuy model with the added value of letting consumers take the product home before all repayments have occured, this created vast value primarily to the retailing industry.  
* A secondary problem being addressed was simplicity and transparency when making repayments, which was a particualary big need state for millenial consumers   

*Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?*

* Afterpay has a high appeal with a Millennial audience. This consumer segment has been drawn to AfterPay's simple and transparent design. 

*What is the unfair advantage they utilize?*

* Afterpay has generated an unfair advantage in this domain through the mass uptake of their product, particularly from merchants, which is part of the Afterpay "fly wheel":
 
    -> merchants acquisition -> consumer acquisition -> increased retailer conversion through online/brick and motor channel

* Additionally the "frictionless" design enables competitive advantage which has been the cornerstone of how Afterpay markets it's offer "feeling good about making repayments". AfterPay consummers that are compliant with repayment programs enable merchants to see an increase in repeat purchases as the process can be repeated and increased in value. This has delivered positive sales growth in traditionally declining physical retail channels & driven AfterPay's scale. We see this symbiotic relationship between AfterPay and Retailer play out as merchants now look to piggy back Afterpay on traditional communication campaigns with messages indicating "AfterPay now availabe", indicating the service is more of a reward to the consumer vs. a payment option.

*Market Segments:*

* Afterpay operates in 2 key markets: Australia and the US
* Since expanding into the US, the platform has onboarded new retailers and approximately 3 million users.
* Australia & New Zealand have a combined 3.3 million users in 2020, which is a growth of approximately 17% from prior year (source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226957/afterpay-active-customers-australia-new-zealand/)

## ***Recommendations***

Recommendation 1: Exclusive Rewards (B2C)

* **Background**: As the Domain and particularly laybuy payment solution becomes more congested, Afterpay will need to continue to build a loyal and engaged consumer offer. Given the core offering of Afterpay is providing conversion and access to branded products and retailers, one strategy for Afterpay to consider would be exclusive rewards. 
* **Mechanic**: An example of this mechanic is consumers reaching a spend threshold to unlock a discount for the total basket eg: spend $x at Country Road and receive 10% off the total price. 
* **Benefit**: The strategy would deliver increased spend and frequency of purchase which would further support retailers and more than offset the discount mechanic. Given the scale and share for Afterpay. As a secondary benefit, the promotion will erode competitor margins should they attempt to replicate the offer with less scale.

Recommendation 2: Revenue Management (B2B)  
* **Background**: AfterPay currently offers it's platform at around 4% of the ticket which makes it one of the lowest priced platforms in the market compared to other offers eg: Uber/ Uber Eats. Given the dominant market position,Afterpay has the ability to increase the rate for it's service offered, this in conjunction with increasing the overall value delivered through the service, beyong the foot traffic and conversion benefit primarily offered currently.
* **Mechanic**:  This can be through a tiered offer ie: bronze/ siliver/ gold/ platinum with each offering features and benefits that will enable retailers to better serve their customers. A platinum account may attract a 7% free, however will come with advanced analytics about adjacent brands/categories that the Afterpay customer buys. A bronze account will only receive access to the Afterpay platform however will not receive any analytics.
* **Benefit**: This model will enable Afterpay to create a pipeline of customers that can also trade up into a more premium customer, the tiering model enables right offer right price and won't result in Afterpay giving away more value than needed to satisfy lower value merchants and visa versa 

Recommendation 3: Rewarding timely payments 

* **Background**: Afterpay has a relatively low default rate on repayments as the service will remove any user that fails to make repayment. However this is still a risk that can be turned into an opportunity by allowing users rewards, particularly for early payment. 
* **Mechanic**: Two examples of how this mechanic could be executed are either through further discounting or through increasing purchase limits for future purchases.
* **Benefit**: This will enable Afterpay to increase its rate of cash and also provide while providing a "value beyond price" solution back to the consumers who will in turn remain more loyal to the platform & increase frequency of purchase as more competitors look to enter.
